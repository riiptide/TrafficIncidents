# Interactive Traffic Incidents Map For New Drivers.



The night before I drove to school for the first time, I went online to find the safest route to school. There was nowhere to find where accidents were most common, which is shocking. I was unfamiliar with the traffic patterns, and I did not know what to look out for.
For our hack, we decided to solve this problem. We created a comprehensive accident map, with data straight from the Princeton Police Department. You and your parents can use our it to see hotspots for accidents and potential areas to avoid, and learn the traffic pattern to get a good sense of the roads in the area.

Enjoy!

# How we made it 
lots of javascript and a sick API called Leaflet

# To run locally
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/riiptide/TrafficIncidents.git`
- `cd` into repo 
- Open the code as a project in your favorite ide, such webstorm or brackets
